Back for year two! I'm sticking with Rust because it was a lot of fun last time
and I don't get a lot of opportunities to write it these days. Maybe TypeScript
would be more beneficial as a learning experience but TypeScript is a horrible
language that only looks redeemable because it's so vastly improved over
regular JavaScript. Aiming for all 25 days again but we'll see how it goes.

## Running

This directory is set up as a Cargo workspace. You can test all solutions
against the sample data by running `cargo test`, and calculate the solutions to
the input in `input.txt` with `cargo run --release`.
