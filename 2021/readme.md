# Advent of Code 2021

This is my first year doing Advent of Code! I'll be completing the challenges in
Rust since I picked it up again earlier this year and really enjoy writing
programs with it. I won't be able to stay up to compete for the global
leaderboards but I do have a private leaderboard which you can join with the
following code: `1500759-b6071a3d`.
