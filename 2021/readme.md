This is my first year doing Advent of Code! I'll be completing the challenges in
Rust since I picked it up again earlier this year and really enjoy writing
programs with it.

## Running

This directory is set up as a Cargo workspace. You can test all solutions
against the sample data by running `cargo test`, and calculate the solutions to
the input in `input.txt` with `cargo run --release`.
