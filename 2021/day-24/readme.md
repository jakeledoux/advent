# 2021: Day 24

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/24

Very little code here because I basically had to do this one on paper. Not a fan
of this puzzle for that reason. Once you've worked out your input's constants
you could write functions that generate the largest and smallest valid checksums
but that doesn't interest me given that it only automates the last 2% of finding
the solution.

I sincerely hope tomorrow's puzzle isn't like this.
