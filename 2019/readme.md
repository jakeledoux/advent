The date is 2021-12-25, and as this year's event comes to a close I embark on a
new journey... to complete Advent of Code 2019. *(mainly because intcode sounds
really fun!)*

Oh and it'll be in Rust again. It's far too soon to try to pick up another
language again. Rust is great :)

## Running

This directory is set up as a Cargo workspace. You can test all solutions
against the sample data by running `cargo test`, and calculate the solutions to
my unique input with `cargo run --release`.
